## 5. FEES AND PAYMENT. 
5.1 The fees applicable to the Services are set forth here 
 [https://Schoolzilla.org](https://Schoolzilla.org) (the “Fee Schedule”), and the Fee Schedule is incorporated 
 herein by this reference.  You understand and agree that fees incurred in 
 connection with the Professional Services may be set forth in the applicable 
 Statement of Work. 
 
5.2 Certain Services carry subscription fees (“Subscription Fees”).  
Subscription Fees will be due on an annual or monthly basis, as agreed by You 
and Schoolzilla (the payment term applicable to You, the “Subscription Term”). 
At the beginning of each Subscription Term during the term of this Agreement, 
Schoolzilla will invoice You (or, if You’ve provided a credit card number 
through Account Administration, will bill that credit card) for the applicable 
Subscription Fees due for the following Subscription Term.  Invoices for 
Subscription Fees must be paid within thirty (30) days after Your receipt thereof.  
If You owe Subscription Fees on a monthly basis, and if Your first month of

You will be charged a pro-rated amount of Subscription Fees for such first 
month, on the first day of such subscription Services.    

5.3 Fees for Professional Services shall be paid within thirty (30) days 
after Your receipt of an invoice therefor, or as otherwise set forth in the 
applicable Statement of Work. 

5.4 Unless otherwise agreed by You and Schoolzilla in writing, all fees 
are non-refundable for any reason, including without limitation if this Agreement 
terminates prior to the end of a Subscription Term for which You have pre-paid 
Subscription Fees.  All amounts due hereunder shall be paid in United States 
Dollars within the United States.  Conversion of foreign currency to United States 
Dollars shall be made at the conversion rate existing in the United States (as 
reported in the Wall Street Journal) on the first working day of the calendar 
month during which the applicable payment is due. 

5.5 If the payment information You have provided is incorrect, 
incomplete, You are late paying any invoice, or Schoolzilla is otherwise unable to 
complete a transaction or collect timely payment due to Your error or omission, 
any payment due hereunder that is so delayed shall bear interest at the rate of one 
and one-half percent (1.5%) per month or the highest rate allowed by applicable 
law, whichever is less.    

##6. TERM AND TERMINATION; SUSPENSION. 

6.1 This Agreement shall remain in full force and effect while You use the 
Service in strict accordance with the terms, conditions, and limitations of this 
Agreement.  Either party may terminate this Agreement for any reason or for no 
reason upon written notice to the other party (email sufficing).  Schoolzilla may 
suspend Your access to the Services and the performance of any Professional 
Services at any time and without notice, if Schoolzilla reasonably believes in its 
sole discretion that You have breached any of the terms of this Agreement.   

6.2 Upon termination of this Agreement for any reason other than Your 
breach, Schoolzilla may, in its discretion and upon Your request, use 
commercially reasonable efforts to provide You with limited assistance to 
transition the Data stored on the Services to a third party or other repository 
designated by You.  Schoolzilla reserves the right to charge fees for such 
transition assistance, on a time and materials basis, at Schoolzilla’s then-current 
rates.  Schoolzilla will not be obligated to provide any such transition assistance 
(a) at any time following the one (1) month anniversary of the effective date of 
termination, or (b) in excess of fifteen (15) man hours, in the aggregate. 

6.3 Upon termination of this Agreement, Your right to use and/or access 
the Services shall terminate, and Schoolzilla will cease performance of any 
Professional Services.  The following provisions shall survive termination of this 
Agreement: Sections 3, 5 (as it relates to payment obligations incurred prior to 
termination), and 6-10 (inclusive). Notwithstanding the foregoing, after 
 termination of this Agreement, You may continue to use Reports created by You, 
 using only Your own Data, that You have downloaded prior to the effective date 
 of termination, solely in accordance with all restrictions herein. 
 
##7. WARRANTIES; WARRANTY DISCLAIMER.   
7.1 The Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act (“FERPA”) requires 
 that U.S. Schools that receive certain federal funds get prior written consent from 
 a parent or guardian of a minor student (“Parent”) before disclosing any 
 educational records regarding such student (“Educational Records”) to third 
 parties.  If You are a School and FERPA applies to You, You hereby designate 
 Schoolzilla (including its employees, contractors, and agents) as an “other school 
 official” under FERPA, who have a “legitimate educational interest” in using and 
 accessing such Educational Records, and  You hereby represent and warrant that 
 (a) You have obtained all consents necessary in connection with disclosing any 
 Educational Records directly or indirectly to Schoolzilla, Users, or otherwise in 
 connection with the Services, and (b) Your disclosures described in (a) are not 
 and will not be a violation of FERPA. 
 
7.2 Schoolzilla hereby represents and warrants to You that (a) it will 
 perform the Professional Services in a professional and workmanlike manner and 
 (b) it will only use and access the Educational Records in accordance with the 
 terms of this Agreement. 
 
7.3 EXCEPT AS EXPRESSLY SET FORTH IN SECTION 7.2, THE 
 SERVICES, PROFESSIONAL SERVICES, REPORTS, AND ANYTHING 
 PROVIDED IN CONNECTION WITH THIS AGREEMENT ARE PROVIDED 
 "AS-IS," WITHOUT ANY WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND.  SCHOOLZILLA 
 HEREBY DISCLAIMS ALL WARRANTIES, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, 
 RELATING TO THE SUBJECT MATTER HEREUNDER, INCLUDING, 
 WITHOUT LIMITATION, ALL IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF 
 MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, TITLE, 
 AND NON-INFRINGEMENT. 
 
##8. LIMITATION OF LIABILITY. 

8.1 IN NO EVENT WILL SCHOOLZILLA (OR ITS LICENSORS OR 
 SUPPLIERS) BE LIABLE FOR (I) ANY INDIRECT, PUNITIVE, 
 INCIDENTAL, SPECIAL, OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING 
 OUT OF OR IN ANY WAY CONNECTED WITH THE USE OF THE 
 SERVICES, PERFORMANCE OF THE PROFESSIONAL SERVICES, OR 
 ANYTHING PROVIDED IN CONNECTION WITH THIS AGREEMENT, (II) 
 THE DELAY OR INABILITY TO USE THE SERVICES OR ANYTHING 
 PROVIDED IN CONNECTION WITH THIS AGREEMENT OR OTHERWISE 
 ARISING FROM THIS AGREEMENT, INCLUDING WITHOUT 
 LIMITATION, LOSS OR CORRUPTION OF DATA, ERROR OR OMISSION 
 IN THE SERVICES, LOSS OF REVENUE OR ANTICIPATED PROFITS OR 
 LOST BUSINESS OR LOST SALES, AND (III) ANY MATTER BEYOND ITS 
 OR THEIR REASONABLE CONTROL, AND ITS OBLIGATIONS 
 HEREUNDER SHALL BE LIMITED TO THE EXERCISE OF 
 COMMERCIALLY REASONABLE EFFORTS; IN EACH CASE, WHETHER 
 BASED IN CONTRACT, TORT (INCLUDING NEGLIGENCE), STRICT 
 LIABILITY, OR OTHERWISE, EVEN IF SCHOOLZILLA HAS BEEN 
 ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF DAMAGES.

 LICENSORS AND SUPPLIERS) ARISING FROM OR RELATING TO THIS 
 AGREEMENT, WHETHER BASED IN CONTRACT, TORT (INCLUDING 
 NEGLIGENCE OR STRICT LIABILITY), OR OTHERWISE, WILL NOT 
 EXCEED, IN THE AGGREGATE, THE AMOUNTS PAID BY YOU TO 
 SCHOOLZILLA IN THE TWELVE (12) MONTH PERIOD PRECEDING THE 
 APPLICABLE CLAIM.

##10. MISCELLANEOUS.  
10.1 If any provision of this Agreement is found to be unenforceable or 
 invalid, that provision will be limited or eliminated to the minimum extent 
 necessary so that this Agreement will otherwise remain in full force and effect 
 and enforceable.   
 
10.2 This Agreement is not (by operation of law or otherwise) assignable, 
 transferable or sublicensable by You except with Schoolzilla’s prior written 
 consent.  Schoolzilla may transfer and assign any of its rights and obligations 
 under this Agreement freely and without consent.   
 
10.3 This Agreement is the complete and exclusive statement of the mutual 
 understanding of the parties and supersedes and cancels all previous written and 
 oral agreements, communications and other understandings relating to the subject 
 matter of this Agreement, and that all waivers and modifications must be in a 
 writing signed by both parties, except as otherwise provided herein.  If there is 
 any conflict between this Agreement and any Statement of Work, this Agreement 
 shall control (except to the extent the parties expressly state in the applicable 
 Statement of Work that it is intended to supersede any conflicting term herein).   
 
10.4 No agency, partnership, joint venture, or employment is created as a 
result of this Agreement and You do not have any authority of any kind to bind

commercial arbitrator with substantial experience in resolving intellectual 
property and commercial contract disputes, who shall be selected from the 
appropriate list of JAMS arbitrators in accordance with the Streamlined 
Arbitration Rules and Procedures of JAMS.  Judgment upon the award so 
rendered may be entered in a court having jurisdiction, or application may be 
made to such court for judicial acceptance of any award and an order of 
enforcement, as the case may be.  Notwithstanding the foregoing, each party shall 
have the right to institute an action in a court of proper jurisdiction for injunctive 
or other equitable relief pending a final decision by the arbitrator.  For all 
purposes of this Agreement, the parties consent to exclusive jurisdiction and 
venue in the state and federal courts in Alameda County, California.
